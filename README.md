# hello-world
My first steps on GitHub, the beginning of a beautiful journey. Started while in exile during Hurricane Matthew.
I am getting conversant with GitHub as there are some projets I want to build, and I'm tired of relying on my more specifically-technical colleagues to get things built or architected. It's time for me to fly like an eagle. Onwards!
